# Operation BONANZA

## Overview

Operation BONANZA is a fictional law enforcement investigation designed to demonstrate how Elasticsearch can be used for criminal intelligence analysis, digital forensics, and operational planning in complex organized crime cases.

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is entirely fictional content created for educational and demonstration purposes only. All names, locations, and criminal activities are fabricated.**

## Purpose

This repository showcases how modern search and analytics technologies can assist law enforcement agencies in:

- **Intelligence Analysis**: Connecting disparate data points across multiple sources
- **Digital Forensics**: Analyzing communications data and financial transactions
- **Operational Planning**: Visualizing criminal networks and identifying key targets
- **Evidence Management**: Organizing and cross-referencing investigative materials

## Fictional Scenario

Operation BONANZA targets a sophisticated organized crime group involved in firearms trafficking, featuring:

- Multi-tier criminal organization with leadership, operational, and distribution levels
- Complex money laundering operations through legitimate businesses
- International supply chains and corrupt officials
- Digital communications evidence and financial intelligence

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Source Data Integration
- **Intelligence Reports**: Structured briefings and assessments
- **Communications Data**: Phone records, messaging, and digital evidence
- **Financial Intelligence**: Banking transactions and suspicious activity
- **Operational Data**: Surveillance logs and field observations

### 2. Advanced Search Capabilities
- **Full-text search** across all investigative materials
- **Fuzzy matching** for names, aliases, and locations
- **Geospatial queries** for location-based analysis
- **Time-based filtering** for timeline reconstruction

### 3. Analytics and Visualization
- **Network analysis** showing relationships between subjects
- **Financial flow tracking** through money laundering operations
- **Communication pattern analysis** identifying key coordination points
- **Operational timeline** visualization for case progression

### 4. Intelligence Gaps Identification
- **Data completeness analysis** highlighting missing information
- **Confidence scoring** for intelligence assessments
- **Evidence correlation** connecting confirmed and suspected activities

## Sample Queries

### Find all communications mentioning specific codenames:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {"match": {"content": "THE PROFESSOR"}},
        {"match": {"content": "NUMBERS"}},
        {"match": {"content": "SNOW WHITE"}}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Analyze financial transactions above threshold:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "amount": {"gte": 3000}
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "by_account": {
      "terms": {"field": "account_number"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Geographic analysis of criminal activities:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "geo_distance": {
      "distance": "50km",
      "location": {
        "lat": 52.4862,
        "lon": -1.8904
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases Demonstrated

### 1. **Criminal Network Mapping**
Visualize relationships between suspects, locations, and criminal activities to identify key targets and operational structure.

### 2. **Financial Investigation**
Track money flows through the Turkish barber shop laundering network, identifying suspicious patterns and undeclared income.

### 3. **Digital Forensics Analysis**
Analyze communications data from seized devices to establish criminal conspiracy and coordination patterns.

### 4. **Operational Intelligence**
