# Operation BONANZA - Comprehensive Intelligence Brief

## Overview

Operation BONANZA is a law enforcement investigation targeting a sophisticated organised crime group (OCG) involved in importing deactivated firearms from Eastern Europe, reactivating them, and distributing functional weapons to street gangs and other criminal organisations across the UK.

## Criminal Enterprise Structure

### **Core Criminal Activity**

The OCG imports deactivated firearms (primarily pistols and revolvers) from Czech Republic and Slovakia, manifested as "vintage military collectibles" or "theatrical props." These weapons are transported to a workshop facility where they are professionally reactivated using machinist expertise, then distributed to street gangs and smaller OCGs across the Midlands and North England. Proceeds are laundered through a network of Turkish barber shops operating on cash-only basis.

## **Modus Operandi**

### **Import Process**

1. SNOW WHITE coordinates with Czech/Slovak suppliers for deactivated weapons
2. Weapons shipped in containers manifested as "vintage military collectibles" or "industrial machinery parts"
3. Danny Wright (Felixstowe) or Kevin Parks (Hull) facilitate customs clearance
4. Containers cleared without physical inspection through corrupt protocols
5. Weapons transported to Terry Mason's Wolverhampton workshop

### **Reactivation Process**

1. Terry Mason uses professional machining equipment to reactivate weapons
2. Converts blank-firing pistols and deactivated weapons to functional firearms
3. Quality control ensures weapons are "singing beautifully" (operational)
4. Storage at workshop facility pending distribution

### **Distribution Network**

1. Jamal Clarke collects weapons for Birmingham street gangs
2. Craig Thompson handles Manchester/Liverpool organised crime groups
3. Pricing varies: £800-1,200 (street level) to £1,500-2,000 (bulk OCG sales)

### **Financial Operations**

1. Cash payments processed through Turkish barber shop network
2. Inflated daily takings reported to justify large cash deposits
3. NUMBERS coordinates financial flows
4. Regular "bonuses" paid to corrupt officials through barber shops
5. Workshop rent and operational costs laundered through same network

## **Intelligence Classification**

### **Confirmed Intelligence (High Confidence)**

- Operational tier identities and roles (Wright, Parks, Mason, Clarke, Thompson) - **ALL ARRESTED**
- Workshop location and activities - **CONFIRMED THROUGH SURVEILLANCE**
- Turkish barber money laundering operations - **CONFIRMED THROUGH FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE**
- Container import methodology - **CONFIRMED THROUGH CUSTOMS RECORDS**
- Distribution pricing and territories - **CONFIRMED THROUGH DIGITAL EVIDENCE**
- Elena KOZLOV identity as SNOW WHITE - **CONFIRMED THROUGH PASSPORT/RESIDENCE RECORDS**

### **Suspected/Unconfirmed (Medium-Low Confidence)**

- Leadership tier identities behind operational codenames:
    - **PROFESSOR** = Marcus Hayes (suspected based on surveillance and criminal intelligence)
    - **NUMBERS** = Rafiq Hassan (suspected based on physical description and vehicle intelligence)
- Exact scope of European supply network
- Full extent of distribution network beyond known associates
- Total volume and frequency of weapon imports
- Complete financial structure and asset holdings

### **OCG Internal Communications Intelligence**

From intercepted communications and digital evidence, the OCG uses the following nicknames internally:
- **"the Professor"** - Leadership figure directing overall strategy
- **"the Sultan"**, **"Sultan"**, **"TS"** - Financial controller managing money flows
- **"Snow White"** - European supply coordinator

## **Recent Developments**

### **Arrests Made**

- **Danny WRIGHT** - Arrested 25/11/24, Samsung Galaxy S22 seized
- **Terry MASON** - Arrested 24/11/24, iPhone 13 seized
- **Jamal CLARKE** - Arrested 23/11/24, Samsung Galaxy A54 seized

### **Digital Evidence Recovered**

Messaging data extracted from seized devices reveals:
- Direct coordination between Wright and Mason for container clearance
- Payment arrangements via Golden Scissors barber shop
- Communications with subjects using OCG nicknames "the Sultan" and "the Professor"
- Operational discussions about weapon quality and distribution
- Evidence of money laundering through Turkish barber network

### **Outstanding Targets**

- **PROFESSOR** - Overall OCG leader (identity unconfirmed)
- **NUMBERS** - Financial controller (identity unconfirmed)
- Kevin PARKS - Corrupt customs official (warrant pending)
- Lisa BRENNAN - Logistics coordinator (surveillance ongoing)

## **Current Investigation Status**

Operation BONANZA has successfully identified and arrested operational-level subjects. Digital forensics from seized devices are providing crucial evidence to link activities to senior leadership figures. Key objectives:

1. **Confirm identity** of PROFESSOR and NUMBERS through additional surveillance and intelligence
2. **Execute arrests** of remaining operational tier (Parks, Brennan)
3. **Dismantle supply chain** from European sources to UK distribution
4. **Target financial network** and seize criminal assets
5. **Identify additional** corrupted officials and criminal associates

The investigation represents a significant threat to organised firearms trafficking in the UK, with potential to disrupt multiple criminal enterprises dependent on this supply chain.
