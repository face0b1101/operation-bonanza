# Operation BONANZA - Comprehensive Intelligence Brief

## Overview

Operation BONANZA is a law enforcement investigation targeting a sophisticated organised crime group (OCG) involved in importing deactivated firearms from Eastern Europe, reactivating them, and distributing functional weapons to street gangs and other criminal organisations across the UK.

## Criminal Enterprise Structure

### **Core Criminal Activity**

The OCG imports deactivated firearms (primarily pistols and revolvers) from Czech Republic and Slovakia, manifested as "vintage military collectibles" or "theatrical props." These weapons are transported to a workshop facility where they are professionally reactivated using machinist expertise, then distributed to street gangs and smaller OCGs across the Midlands and North England. Proceeds are laundered through a network of Turkish barber shops operating on cash-only basis.

- Financial arrangements (€21,250 per shipment)
- Manifesting protocols ("theatrical props", "vintage military collectibles")

## **Current Investigation Status**

Operation BONANZA has achieved significant operational success:

### **Operational Tier Dismantled**

- Primary logistics coordinator (Lisa Brennan) arrested with comprehensive digital evidence
- Workshop operations disrupted (Terry Mason arrested)
- Key distribution coordinators arrested (Jamal Clarke)
- Customs corruption network partially exposed (Danny Wright arrested)

### **Outstanding Priority Targets**

- **PROFESSOR** - Overall OCG leader (identity requires confirmation)
- **NUMBERS** - Financial controller (identity requires confirmation)
- **Kevin PARKS** - Corrupt Hull customs official (warrant pending)
- **Craig THOMPSON** - Manchester/Liverpool distribution coordinator (at large)

### **Current Objectives**

Digital forensics from seized devices are providing crucial evidence to link activities to senior leadership figures. Key objectives:

1. **Confirm identity** of PROFESSOR and NUMBERS through additional surveillance and intelligence
2. **Execute arrests** of remaining operational tier (Parks, Thompson)
3. **Dismantle supply chain** from European sources to UK distribution
4. **Target financial network** and seize criminal assets
5. **Identify additional** corrupted officials and criminal associates

### **Operational Impact**

The arrests have caused significant disruption:
- European supply chain compromised (shipments cancelled/delayed)
- Workshop operations ceased
- Birmingham distribution network disrupted
- Financial flows through barber network under scrutiny

The investigation represents a significant threat to organised firearms trafficking in the UK, with potential to disrupt multiple criminal enterprises dependent on this supply chain.
